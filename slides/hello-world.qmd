## Data science


Data science is about making decisions based on incomplete information. 

. . .

This concept is not new. Brains were built for doing this!




## But we have new tools and lots more data!

## Data science workflow

The folks who wrote [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) proposed the following data science workflow:

## Overview of course

We will spend the first few weeks getting comfortable **programming in R**, including some useful skills for data science:

- R basics
- Data importing
- Data visualization 
- Data wrangling 

## Overview of course

Then, we will spend the next several weeks building a **foundation in basic statistics and model building**: 

- Probability distributions
- Sampling variability
- Hypothesis testing
- Model specification
- Model fitting 
- Model accuracy
- Model reliability

## Overview of course

Finally we will cover a selection of **more advanced topics** that are often applied in language and mind fields, with a focus on basic understanding: 

- Classification
- Feature engineering (preprocessing) 
- Inference for regression
- Mixed-effect models

## Syllabus, briefly

Each week will include two lectures and a lab: 

- **Lectures** are on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 10:15am and will be a mix of conceptual overviews and R tutorials. It is a good idea to bring your laptop so you can follow along and try stuff in R!
- **Lab** is on Thursday or Friday and will consist of (ungraded) practice problems and concept review with TAs. You may attend any lab section that works for your schedule. 

## Syllabus, briefly

There are 10 graded assessments: 

- **6 Problem sets** in which you will be asked to apply your newly aquired R programming skills.
- **4 Quizzes** in which you will be tested on your understanding of lecture concepts. 

## Syllabus, briefly

There are a few policies to take note of: 

- Missed quizzes cannot be made up except in cases of genuine conflict or emergency (documentation and course action notice required)
- You may request an extension on any problem set of up to 3 days. But extensions beyond 3 days will not be granted (because delying solutions will negative impact other students). 
- You may submit any missed quiz or problem set by the end of the semester for half-credit (50%).

## Why R? 

With many programming languages available for data science (e.g. R, Python, Julia, MATLAB), why use R?

- Built for stats, specifically 
- Makes nice visualizations
- Lots of people are doing it, especially in academia
- Easier for beginners to understand
- Free and open source (though so are Python and Julia, MATLAB costs $)

## Many ways to use R

- [R Studio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/)
- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) 
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/r)
- and even simply the [command line/terminal](http://mercury.webster.edu/aleshunas/R_learning_infrastructure/Using%20the%20R%20command%20line.html)

## Google Colab

- **Google Colab** is a cloud-based Jupyter notebook that allows you to write, execute, and share code like a google doc. 
- We use Google Colab because it's simple and accessible to everyone. You can start programming right away, no setup required! 

## Secretly, R! 

Google Colab officially supports Python, but secretly supports R (and [Julia](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ageron/julia_notebooks/blob/master/Julia_Colab_Notebook_Template.ipynb), too!)
