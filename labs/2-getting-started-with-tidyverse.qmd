Practice quiz questions.


1. Suppose we run the following code block. What will `is.data.frame(y)` return? 

    ```r
    y <- tibble(x=1:2, y=1)`
    ```

1. Suppose `print(x)` returns the output below to answer a-c that follow. 

    ```

    # output
    
    ```
    a. What will `map_dbl(x, sum)` return? 
    b. What will `x$a` return? 
    c. What will `x[[5]]` return? 

1. Suppose `x[[5]]` returns `NULL`, what will `is_tibble(x)` return? 

1. Can `readr` import a google sheet with the `read_csv()` function?
