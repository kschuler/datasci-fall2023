To remind you, here is the data.\n\nThe dataset below includes data simulated from work done by Carolyn Rovee-Collier. Dr. Rovee-Collier developed a new way to study very young babies' ability to remember things over time: the \"mobile conjugate reinforcement paradigm\". See a video of this paradim [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgOu_Uc00ao) and a nice description from Merz et al (2017) here:\n\n>  \"In this task, one end of a ribbon is tied around an infant’s ankle and the other end is connected to a mobile hanging over his/her crib. Through experience with this set-up, the infant learns the contingency between kicking and movement of the mobile. After a delay, the task is repeated, and retention is measured by examining whether the infant kicks more during the retention phase than at baseline (i.e., spontaneous kicking prior to the learning trials; Rovee-Collier, 1997). Developmental research using the mobile conjugate reinforcement paradigm has demonstrated that both the speed of learning and length of retention increase with age\"\n\n```r\n\"https://kathrynschuler.com/datasets/rovee_collier_1989.csv\"\n```\n\nThe simulated dataset includes 4 variables: \n\n1. `ratio` - the measure of retention \n2. `day` - the delay in days (1 through 14)\n3. `age` - the age group: 2 month olds or 3 month olds\n3. `age_recoded` - the age group recoded as 0 (2 month olds) and 1 (3 month olds)\n\nSuppose you would like to predict the babies’ retention ratio by day and age (as you did in pset 3).\n\n## Problem 1: Data exploration \n\n- Load the dataset and perform the following exploratory data analysis\n- Examine the dataset’s structure (glimpse), summary statistics, and handle missing values if any.\n- Visualize the pairwise relationship between the response variable and each of the three explanatory variables using appropriate plots (scatter plots, histograms, etc.).\n\n## Problem 2: Model specification \n\n- Choose an appropriate type of model and explain why you've selected this model (e.g. regression, classification) \n- Specify the functional form of the model with an equation in a colab text block (e.g. $y = \\beta_0$). \n- Specify the model in R code (e.g. `y ~ 1`) \n\n## Problem 3: Model fitting \n\n- Fit the specified model. \n- What does the model tell us? How does babies' retention ratio change with age and day? \n- What is the meaning of the intercept of this model? \n\n## Problem 4: Conditions for inference \n\n- Use the `check_model` function to test whether the conditions for inference are satisfied. \n- Does the model satisfy the conditions for Linearity, Normality, and Equality? For each condition, describe what it refers to and explain how the plot returned by `check_model` suggests whether it does (or does not) satisfy the condition. \n- Is the condition for Independence satisfied? Explain why or why not. If not, describe some options for fixing this.\n\n\n## Problem 5: Hypothesis testing models\n\n- Perform a hypothesis test on your model with `anova` \n- Is there a significant main effect of age or day? How do you know? \n- Interpret what this means for the research question: How does babies' retention ratio change with age and day? \n\n\n## Problem 6: Model predictions\n\n- Using the coefficients returned from your model in Problem 3 what is the model's predicted retention ratio for:\n  - a baby who is 2 months old after a delay of 5 days? \n  - a baby who is 3 months old after a delay of 20 days? \n  - a baby who is 2 months old after a delay of -2 days? This one doesn't make sense (we can't have a delay of -2 days). Does the model generate a prediction in this case? How should we interpret this prediction?
