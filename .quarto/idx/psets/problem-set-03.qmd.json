Dr. Rovee-Collier developed a new way to study very young babies' ability to remember things over time: the \"mobile conjugate reinforcement paradigm\". See a video of this paradim [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgOu_Uc00ao) and a nice description from Merz et al (2017) here:\n\n>  \"In this task, one end of a ribbon is tied around an infant’s ankle and the other end is connected to a mobile hanging over his/her crib. Through experience with this set-up, the infant learns the contingency between kicking and movement of the mobile. After a delay, the task is repeated, and retention is measured by examining whether the infant kicks more during the retention phase than at baseline (i.e., spontaneous kicking prior to the learning trials; Rovee-Collier, 1997). Developmental research using the mobile conjugate reinforcement paradigm has demonstrated that both the speed of learning and length of retention increase with age\"\n\n```r\n\"https://kathrynschuler.com/datasets/rovee_collier_1989.csv\"\n```\n\nThe simulated dataset includes 4 variables: \n\n1. `ratio` - the measure of retention \n2. `day` - the delay in days (1 through 14)\n3. `age` - the age group: 2 month olds or 3 month olds\n3. `age_recoded` - the age group recoded as 0 (2 month olds) and 1 (3 month olds)\n\nExplore these data with (at least) glimpse and a scatterplot. Include ratio on the y-axis, day on the x-axis, and color the dots by age. You may include any other explorations you wish to perform.\n\n\n## Problem 2 \n\nSuppose you have specified that you will use a linear regression model to predict the simulated Rovee-Collier babies' retention ratio by day and age. Your model can be represented by the following equation: \n\n$y=w_0 + w_1x_1 + w_2x_2$, where:\n\n- $y$ = ratio\n- $x_1$ = day \n- $x_2$ = age \n\nFit the specified model using ordinary least squares approach with each of the three different functions we learned in the tutorial: (1) with `lm`, (2) with `infer`, and (3) with `parsnip`. Did all three ways return the same parameter estimates? Explain why or why not.\n\n## Problem 3 \n\nGiven the specified model and the parameters estimated in problem 2, compute the sum of squared error for the fitted model.\n\n> Note: if you are stuck on Problem 2, you may proceed with this problem by using all zeros as your parameter estimates. \n\n## Problem 4 \n\nExpanding on problem 3, write a more general function that would allow you to compute the sum of squared errors for the model specified in problem 2. Your function should take two inputs: (1) the data and (2) the parameter estimates. Your function should return a single value as output. Test your function with each of the following parameter values:\n\n1. 0, 0, 0\n2. 2, -3, 5\n3. 1, 2, 3\n\nWhich of these three options fit the data best? How do you know? \n\n## Problem 5\n\nUse the `optimg` package to find the optimal parameter estimates for the model specified in problem 2 via gradient descent. Initialize your search with $b_0=0$, $b_1=0$, and $b_2=0$. How many iterations were necessary to estimate the parameters? Are the parameters estimated by your gradient descent the same as those returned by `lm()`? Explain why or why not.\n\n## Problem 6 \n\nThe function given below finds the ordinary least squares estimate via matrix operations given two inputs: $X$, a matrix containing the input/explanatory variables, and $Y$, a matrix containing the output/response variable. \n\n```r\n ols_matrix_way <- function(X, Y){\n  solve(t(X) %*% X) %*% t(X) %*% Y\n }\n```\n\nUse this function to estimate the free parameters of the model specified in problem 2. Are the parameters estimated by the matrix operation the same as those returned by `lm()`?
