Add a text block that includes the title \"Problem set 1\", your name, and the date. Add a text block with a heading for each problem in the set. As you work through the problem set, include your code/solutions below the appropriate heading. Finally, load the `tidyverse` package under your heading for problem 0.\n\n\n## Problem 1\n\nSuppose you record how many words your quiet roommate says to you each day for a week. Convert the vector given below from strings to doubles using coercion and store it as `words_spoken`. Use R's built-in functions to compute the total number of words your roommate said that week, the average number of words spoken per day, and the maximum number of words spoken on a single day. Store the results in a tibble. Perform a comparison operation on the `words_spoken` vector to determine whether each day's words were above the average. Finally, use subsetting to extract the days where the number of words were in the single digits.\n\n```r\nwords_spoken_stringy <- c(\"5\", \"3\", \"20\",\" 0\", \"4\", \"35\", \"1\")\n```\n\n## Problem 2\n\nCreate the matrix given below. Use one of R's built-in functions to append a new row to the matrix made up of all 1s.  Multiply every number in the new matrix by 5. Then use subsetting to return the second and fourth row of values in the final matrix. \n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\nx <- c(3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11)\nmatrix(x, nrow=3, ncol=3)\n\n```\n\n\n## Problem 3\n\nCreate a data frame that looks like the one below. Return the structure of the dataframe with `str()`. Use subsetting to select all columns that were indicated as doubles. Compute the mean of each column in the subset dataframe using `map_*()` and convert the output to a tibble (use the pipe!).\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\nage <- c(30, 45, 81, 27)\nheight <- c(65, 66, 72, 59)\nmajor <- c(\"cogsci\", \"ling\", \"psych\", \"ling\")\nscore <- c(100, 75, 88, 97)\nfirstgen <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)\ndf <- data.frame(age, height, major, score, firstgen)\ndf\n\n\n```\n\n## Problem 4\nRead the documentation for the [`emo`](https://github.com/hadley/emo) package.  Install and load the package. Then create a character vector including 8 of your favorite emojis by their keyword (see the docs for a list). Finally, use the package's `emo::ji()` function in conjunction with `map_*()` to print all 8 emojis with one line of code. Combine this output with your keyword vector in a tibble.  \n\n## Problem 5 \n\nSuppose you extend your experiment: you decide to record the number of words your quiet roommate says to you every day for the entire semester. Import the file below from the given url, ensuring that `week` is an integer vector, `words spoken` is a double, and all column names are valid variable names in R. Take care to use the approaches we discussed in lecture to identify and handle any issues. Use `glimpse` to show the resulting tibble. Finally, use these data to recreate (as faithfully as possible) the figure below. \n\n```r\n\"https://kathrynschuler.com/datasets/quiet_roommate.csv\"\n```\n\n![](/include/targets/pset-1-target-5.png){#target-5 fig-align=\"center\" width=50%}\n\n## Problem 6\n\nProblem 6 makes use of the `english` dataset in the [`languageR`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/languageR/languageR.pdf) package.

Convert the `english` dataset to a tibble, then use `glimpse` to show the result.
