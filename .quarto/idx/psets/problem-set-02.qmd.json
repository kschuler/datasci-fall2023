Please include the title \"Problem set 2\", your name, the date, and any collaborators somewhere at the top. \n\n<!-- You must make all visualizations with `ggplot` (via `infer`, where appropriate) and ensure your plots communicate information clearly.  -->\n\n## Problem 1 \n\nSuppose you want to simulate data for the age at which typically developing babies produce their first word. Create a tibble with a single column for age that includes 500 samples generated from the Gaussian probability distribution with a mean age of 12 months and a standard deviation of 1 month. Plot your data with a density plot. Given this Gaussian distirbution, what is the probability that a baby says their first word by the time they are 10 months? Return this value with one of R's functions for probability distributions.\n\n## Problem 2\n\nThe dataset below includes data simulated from [Ritchie et al 2018](https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article/28/8/2959/4996558?fbclid=IwAR3I9IcKIlGqDzW-GDzF7v0ZWGO0mPx2RP8raCWDUJS7nWVEMsk8yY3wLlw&login=false), including the total brain `volume` and `sex` of 5216 subjects. Suppose you are interested in just one sex. Filter the data to include only male or only female participants (data scientists choice!). Explore these data with a histogram and use `summarise()` to report both paramteric and nonparamteric summary statistics. \n\n> Note that your research assistant has accidentally coded sex female as `NA`. You'll need to solve this issue with your dplyr skills!\n\n```r\n\"http://kathrynschuler.com/datasets/brain_volume.csv\"\n```\n\n## Problem 3\n\nContinuing with your filtered brain volume data, use `infer` to construct the bootstrap sampling distribution of the mean brain volume and quantify the spread of the distribution with standard error. Create a visualization that includes a histogram of the distribution and a shaded confidence interval with the standard error you computed.\n\n## Problem 4\n\nSuppose you now want to know whether there is a difference in *median* brain volume between the sexes. Use `infer` to construct the null distribution and to compute the observed difference in medians. Visualize the null distribution and shade the p-value, including the observed difference in medians. Return the p-value. Should you reject the null hypothesis? Why or why not? \n\n## Problem 5 \n\nSuppose you asked each participant to think of a number (integer) between 1 and 100. Assume each participant is equally likely to select a given number. Add a column to the brain volume data that samples from this distribution for all 5216 participants. Coerce this column to an integer if necessary. Explore this new variable with a histogram and summary statistics appropriate for this distribution.\n\n## Problem 6 \n\nSuppose you now want to know whether participant brain volume is correlated with the random number they selected. Explore this relationship with a scatter plot. Use `infer` to construct the null distribution and to compute the observed correlation. Visualize the null distribution and shade the p-value, including the observed correlation. Return the p-value. Should you reject the null hypothesis? Why or why not? \n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Estimated time: 6 hours\n\nAllocate about **1 hour per problem**, though some will take longer than others.
