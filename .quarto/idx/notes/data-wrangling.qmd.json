But you should feel comfortable reading the docs/resources to use others to solve unique problems.* \n\n## Manipulating rows\n\n\n**`filter()`** filters rows, allowing you to keep only some rows based on the values of the columns. \n\n- the first argument is a data frame (all dplyr verbs)\n- subsequent arguments are the conditions that must be true to keep the row (using R's logical and comparison operators we learned in [R basics](/notes/r-basics.qmd)!), e.g. `filter(age > 18)`\n- a common filtering mistake is to use `=` instead of the logical operator `==`! \n\n**`arrange()`** arranges the rows in the order you specify based on column values (does not change the number of rows, just changes their order)\n\n- the first argument is a data frame (all dplyr verbs)\n- subsequent arguments are a set of column names to order by \n- note that the default order is ascending, but you can specify descending by wrapping the column in the `desc()` function \n\n**`distinct()`** finds unique rows in a dataset, but you can also provide column names \n\n- the first argument is a data frame\n- optionally subsequent arguments provides column names to find the distinct combination of some variables \n- note that if you provide column names, distinct will only return those columns unless you add the argument `.keep_all=TRUE`\n\n\n## Manipulating columns\n\n**`mutate()`** adds new columns that are calculated from existing columns \n\n- first argument is a data frame (all dplyr verbs)\n- subsequent arguments are the new column name, an equals sign, followed by an expression you want to use to calculate the new value, e.g. `difference=age_end - age_start` \n- by default new columns are added to the right, but the `.before` and `.after` arguments allows you to add them before/after specific positions (by position number, e.g. `.before=1` or by column name, e.g. `before=age`)\n\n**`select()`** selects columns based on their names  \n\n- first argument is a data frame (all dplyr verbs)\n- subsequent arguments can be the names of the columns you want to keep \n- use the `:` operator to select everything from one column to another, e.g. `age:height`\n- you can also use logical operators like `&` (and) or `!` (not) to identify the subset of columns you want to select, e.g. `!age:height`\n- you can also rename columns within select by putting the name of the column and an equals sign before the column you want to select, e.g. `new_name=selected_column`\n\n**`rename()`** we've already seen this function when importing data. Rename is used when want to keep all of our columns but rename one or more.  \n\n- first argument is a data frame (all dplyr verbs)\n- subsequent arguments are the columns we would like to rename, e.g. `new_colname=old_colname`\n\n\n## Group and summarise\n\nIn addition to manipulating rows and columns in your dataset, `dplyr` also allows you to work with groups\n\n**`group_by()`** is used to divide your dataset into groups that are meaningful for your analysis. \n\n-  `group_by()` doesn't change the data, but adds a groups attribute, which tells R that subsequent operations will be performed by group \n- you can tell if a data frame is grouped by the first line of the output (or with `attributes()`!)\n\n\n**`summarise()`** is often used after `group_by()` to calculate summary statistics on grouped data, which returns a data frame with a single row for each group \n\n- you can add any number of summary stats; usually you want to name them something that makes sense for your analysis  \n- `n()` is a particularly useful summary stat to add to [our list](/notes/r-basics.qmd#built-in-functions) that returns a count \n- use the argument `na.rm=TRUE` to compute the summary statistics with NAs removed (remember they are contageous!)\n- note that the returned data frame is iteself grouped, but in a [quirky way](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-transform#grouping-by-multiple-variables), with one fewer group (you may get a warning about this). You can add the argument **`.groups=\"drop\"`** to drop all groups or **`.groups=\"keep\"`** to keep them all\n- to avoid this quirk, `summarise()` also has a cool new **`.by`** argument that can be used **instead of calling `group_by()`**, which always returns an ungrouped data frame.\n\n**`ungroup()`** is used to remove the grouping attribute from a data frame\n\n\n\n\n## More advanced \n\nThere are a few more advanced techniques for transforming and tidying data that we won't cover now, but might be useful to you in your own research.\n\n- **joins** - sometimes you have more than one dataset that you want to join into one. `dplyr` also has functions for handling that. [Learn more about joins](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/joins)\n- **pivots** - sometimes your data doesn't arrive in the tidy data form.  The `tidyr` package can help with  `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()`.
