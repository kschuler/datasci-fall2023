Data science is the discipline of drawing conclusions from data using computation.\n> \n> -- *Computational and Inferential Thinking: The Foundations of Data Science*\n\nData science is about making decisions based on incomplete information.

Data scientists clean and preprocess the data, which involves removing errors, handling missing values, and transforming data into a suitable format for analysis.\n\n3. **Visualize (exploratory data analysis)** visualize and summarize data to identify patterns, form hypotheses, select appropriate models, and guide further analysis.\n\n4. **Model:** Using statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, and other computational techniques, data scientists build models to understand underlying patterns in the data. Models are tested using validation techniques to ensure their accuracy and reliability. Then data scientists use them to draw meaningful conclusions, like predictions about the future or inferences about populuation. \n\n5. **Communicate:** Finally, a crucial part of data science is communicating findings clearly and effectively, whatever your purpose (academic, industry, or the public!) \n\n6. **Program**: Surrounding all these is programming, since the computational tools are what make these possible! \n\nData science has applications in many fields far beyond language and the mind. It allows us to make data-driven decisions, solve complex problems, and uncover hidden insights that might not be apparent through other methods.\n\n## Overview of the course\n\nWe will spend the first few weeks getting comfortable **programming in R**, including some useful skills for data science:\n\n- R basics\n- Data importing\n- Data visualization \n- Data wrangling \n\nThen, we will spend the next several weeks building a **foundation in basic statistics and model building**: \n\n- Probability distributions\n- Sampling variability\n- Hypothesis testing\n- Model specification\n- Model fitting \n- Model accuracy\n- Model reliability\n\nFinally we will cover a selection of **more advanced topics** that are often applied in language and mind fields, with a focus on basic understanding: \n\n- Classification\n- Feature engineering (preprocessing) \n- Inference for regression\n- Mixed-effect models\n\n## Syllabus, briefly\n\nEach week will include two lectures and a lab: \n\n- **Lectures** are on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 10:15am and will be a mix of conceptual overviews and R tutorials. It is a good idea to bring your laptop so you can follow along and try stuff in R!\n- **Lab** is on Thursday or Friday and will consist of (ungraded) practice problems and concept review with TAs. You may attend any lab section that works for your schedule. \n\nThere are 10 graded assessments: \n\n- **6 Problem sets** in which you will be asked to apply your newly aquired R programming skills.\n- **4 Quizzes** in which you will be tested on your understanding of lecture concepts. \n\nThere are a few policies to take note of: \n\n- Missed quizzes cannot be made up except in cases of genuine conflict or emergency (documentation and course action notice required)\n- You may request an extension on any problem set of up to 3 days. But extensions beyond 3 days will not be granted (because delying solutions will negative impact other students). \n- You may submit any missed quiz or problem set by the end of the semester for half-credit (50%).\n\n## Why R? \n\nWith many programming languages available for data science (e.g. R, Python, Julia, MATLAB), why use R?\n\n- Built for stats, specifically \n- Makes nice visualizations\n- Lots of people are doing it, especially in academia\n- Easier for beginners to understand\n- Free and open source (though so are Python and Julia, MATLAB costs $)\n\nIf you are interested, here is a [math professor's take](https://tobydriscoll.net/blog/matlab-vs.-julia-vs.-python/) on the differences between Python, Julia, and MATLAB. Note that although they're optimized for different things, **they are all great** and the technical skills and conceptual knowledge you gain in this course will transfer to other languages.\n\n## Google Colab\n\nThere are many ways to program with R. Some popular options include:\n\n- [R Studio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/)\n- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) \n- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/r)\n- and even simply the [command line/terminal](http://mercury.webster.edu/aleshunas/R_learning_infrastructure/Using%20the%20R%20command%20line.html)\n\n**Google Colab** is a cloud-based Jupyter notebook that allows you to write, execute, and share code like a google doc. We use Google Colab because it's simple and accessible to everyone. You can start programming right away, no setup required!
