Below we computed these descriptive statistics on our simulated data. Then, we used `infer` to generate the sampling distribution for the 3-7 year old age group, visualize the distribution, and shade the confidence interval. \n\n```{r}\n# A. compute descriptive statistics by group \njohnson_newport_1989 %>% \n    group_by(ageGroup) %>%\n    summarise(n = n(), mean = mean(score), sd = sd(score))\n```\n\n```{r}\n# B. generate the sampling distribution for 3-7 group\nsamp_distribution <- johnson_newport_1989 %>%\n    filter(ageGroup == \"3-7\") %>%\n    specify(response = score) %>%\n    generate(reps = 1000, type = \"bootstrap\") %>% \n    calculate(stat = \"mean\") \n```\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| message: false\n\n# hide ci so we can ask about getting the ci a few ways\nci <- samp_distribution %>%\n    get_confidence_interval(level = 0.68, type = \"percentile\")\n\nci2 <- samp_distribution %>%\n    get_confidence_interval(type = \"se\", point_estimate = 271)\n\n```\n\n```r\n# C. get confidence interval \nci <- samp_distribution %>%\n    get_confidence_interval(______________)\n\n```\n\n```{r}\n#| layout-ncol: 2\n\n# D. visualize sampling distribution and confidence interval \nsamp_distribution %>%\n    visualize() +\n    shade_ci(endpoints = ci)\n```\n\n(a) True or false, the descriptive statistics reported above are parametric.\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| results: asis\n\n# Define the answer choices\nchoices <- c(\n    answer=TRUE, \n    FALSE\n)\n\ncat(longmcq(choices))\n```\n\n(b) The sampling distribution of the mean looks approximately Gaussian.

True or false, the null hypothesis here is that the observed difference in means is due to nothing but chance. \n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| results: asis\n\n# Define the answer choices\nchoices <- c(\n    answer=TRUE, \n    FALSE\n)\n\ncat(longmcq(choices))\n```\n\n(b) Step 2 is to ask, if the null hypothesis is true, how likely is our observed pattern of results? We quantify this likelihood with:\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| results: asis\n\n# Define the answer choices\nchoices <- c(\n    \"diff in means\",\n    answer=\"p-value\", \n    \"correlation\",\n    \"response\"\n)\n\ncat(longmcq(choices))\n```\n\n(c) Step 3 is to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis. Johnson and Newport concluded that the two groups were not significantly different from each other, suggesting that participants who arrived to the US by age 7 acheived native proficiency. This implies that they `r mcq(c(\"reject the null hypothesis\", answer=\"fail to reject the null hypothsis\"))`\n\n\n(d) Given our simulated null distribution, do you agree with their decision? Explain why based on the simulation.\n\n```{r}\n#| code-fold: true\n#| code-summary: \"Answer\"\n#| eval: false\n\n\"I agree with their decision. Under the null hypothesis, the observed\n difference in means is just under -2. Given the shaded p-value, we \n can see that observing this difference is fairly likely under the \n null hypothesis. So we should fail to reject the null hypothsis.\"\n\n```\n\n\n\n## 3 Correlation \n\nJohnson and Newport (1989) also wanted to address the following question:\n\n> \"An important question to answer is whether, throughout adulthood, performance continues to decline as a function of age of exposure or whether it plateaus at some point (H. Gleitman, personal communication). If the explanation for late learnersâ€™ poorer performance relates to maturation, performance should not continue to decline over age, for presumably there are not many important maturational differences between, for example, the brain of a 17-year old and the brain of a 27-year old...\" ~ page 79\n\nTo address this question, they separated subjects into two groups: those who arrived as children, between the ages of 3-15 (figure A) and those who arrived as adults, between the ages of 17-39 (figure B). For each group, they computed the correlation between age of exposure and score on the English proficiency test.\n\n\n(a) Given the scatterplots of these data, which of the following could be their observed correlations for these groups? \n\n\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false \n#| layout-ncol: 2\n\njohnson_newport_1989 %>%\n    filter(ageGroup %in% c(\"3-7\", \"8-10\", \"11-15\")) %>%\n    ggplot(aes(x = age, y = score)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    labs(tag = \"A\", title = \"Subjects Arriving Ages 3-15 (kids)\")\n\njohnson_newport_1989 %>%\n    filter(ageGroup == \"17-39\") %>%\n    ggplot(aes(x = age, y = score)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    labs(tag = \"B\", title = \"Subjects Arriving Ages 17-39 (adults)\")\n\n\n```\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| results: asis\n\n# Define the answer choices\nchoices <- c(\n    \"A: r = -0.0276, B: r = -0.884\",\n    answer=\"A: r = -0.884, B: r = -0.0276\",\n    \"A: r = 0.884, B: r = -0.0276\"\n)\n\ncat(longmcq(choices))\n```\n\n(b) True or false, the correlations computed on these data were subject to sampling variability.\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| results: asis\n\n# Define the answer choices\nchoices <- c(\n    answer=TRUE, \n    FALSE\n)\n\ncat(longmcq(choices))\n```\n\n(c) Johnson and Newport used hypothesis testing to determine whether the correlation they observed for each group was significantly different from zero. Focusing on group B (arrived to US between 17-39) we computed a p-value of `0.942` on the correlation we observed in our simulated data. Which figure could represent this p-value visualized on a null distribution generated nonparametrically from 1000 repetitions? \n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n\nadults <- johnson_newport_1989 %>% \n    filter(ageGroup == \"17-39\") \n\nobs_corr <- adults %>%\n    specify(response = score, explanatory = age) %>%\n    calculate(stat = \"correlation\") \n\nnull_distribution <- adults %>%\n    specify(response = score, explanatory = age) %>%\n    hypothesize(null = \"independence\") %>%\n    generate(reps = 1000, type = \"permute\") %>%\n    calculate(stat = \"correlation\") \n\n```\n\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false \n#| layout-ncol: 3\n\nnull_distribution %>%\n    visualize() +\n    shade_p_value(0.9, direction = \"two-sided\") +\n    labs(tag = \"A\")\n\nnull_distribution %>%\n    visualize() +\n    shade_p_value(obs_corr, direction = \"two-sided\") +\n    labs(tag = \"B\")\n\nnull_distribution %>%\n    visualize() +\n    shade_p_value(0.336, direction = \"two-sided\") +\n    labs(tag = \"C\")\n\n```\n\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| results: asis\n\n# Define the answer choices\nchoices <- c(\n    \"A\", answer=\"B\", \"C\"\n)\n\ncat(longmcq(choices))\n```\n\n(d) What type of relationship would a correlation between age and score suggest? \n\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| results: asis\n\n# Define the answer choices\nchoices <- c(\n    answer=\"linear\",\n    \"nonlinear\",\n    \"independence\",\n    \"none of the above\"\n)\n\ncat(longmcq(choices))\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n## 4 Model specification\n\nTwo different models: A and B, represented by the blue and red lines. \n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| layout-ncol: 2\njohnson_newport_1989 %>%\nfilter(ageGroup != \"0\") %>%\nggplot(\naes(x = age, y = score)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_smooth(\n        method = \"lm\", \n        formula = \"y ~ 1\",\n        se = FALSE, \n        linewidth = 2\n    ) + labs(tag = \"A\")\n\njohnson_newport_1989 %>%\nfilter(ageGroup != \"0\") %>%\nggplot(\naes(x = age, y = score)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_smooth(\n        method = \"lm\", \n        formula = \"y ~ x\",\n        se = FALSE, \n        linewidth = 2,\n        color = \"red\"\n    ) + labs(tag = \"B\")\n\n```\n\n\n(a) Which of the following best describes model A (blue line)?\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| results: asis\n\n# Define the answer choices\nchoices <- c(\n    answer = \"supervised learning, regression model\",\n    \"unsupervised learning, regression model\",\n    \"supervised learning, classification model\",\n    \"unsupervised learning, classification model\"\n)\n\ncat(longmcq(choices))\n```\n\n(b) Suppose the model B (red line) is specified with the response variable (score) and one explanatory variable (age).

So we should fail to reject the null hypothsis.\"\n\n```\n\n\n\n## 3 Correlation \n\nJohnson and Newport (1989) also wanted to address the following question:\n\n> \"An important question to answer is whether, throughout adulthood, performance continues to decline as a function of age of exposure or whether it plateaus at some point (H. Gleitman, personal communication). If the explanation for late learnersâ€™ poorer performance relates to maturation, performance should not continue to decline over age, for presumably there are not many important maturational differences between, for example, the brain of a 17-year old and the brain of a 27-year old...\" ~ page 79\n\nTo address this question, they separated subjects into two groups: those who arrived as children, between the ages of 3-15 (figure A) and those who arrived as adults, between the ages of 17-39 (figure B). For each group, they computed the correlation between age of exposure and score on the English proficiency test.\n\n\n(a) Given the scatterplots of these data, which of the following could be their observed correlations for these groups? \n\n\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false \n#| layout-ncol: 2\n\njohnson_newport_1989 %>%\n    filter(ageGroup %in% c(\"3-7\", \"8-10\", \"11-15\")) %>%\n    ggplot(aes(x = age, y = score)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    labs(tag = \"A\", title = \"Subjects Arriving Ages 3-15 (kids)\")\n\njohnson_newport_1989 %>%\n    filter(ageGroup == \"17-39\") %>%\n    ggplot(aes(x = age, y = score)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    labs(tag = \"B\", title = \"Subjects Arriving Ages 17-39 (adults)\")\n\n\n```\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| results: asis\n\n# Define the answer choices\nchoices <- c(\n    \"A: r = -0.0276, B: r = -0.884\",\n    answer=\"A: r = -0.884, B: r = -0.0276\",\n    \"A: r = 0.884, B: r = -0.0276\"\n)\n\ncat(longmcq(choices))\n```\n\n(b) True or false, the correlations computed on these data were subject to sampling variability.\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| results: asis\n\n# Define the answer choices\nchoices <- c(\n    answer=TRUE, \n    FALSE\n)\n\ncat(longmcq(choices))\n```\n\n(c) Johnson and Newport used hypothesis testing to determine whether the correlation they observed for each group was significantly different from zero. Focusing on group B (arrived to US between 17-39) we computed a p-value of `0.942` on the correlation we observed in our simulated data.
