If you finish early, you may turn in your quiz and leave early\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\\newcommand\\answerbox{%%\n    \\framebox(400,50){}}\n\n\\begin{flushleft}\n\\makebox[12cm]{\\textbf{Name}:\\ \\hrulefill}\n\\medskip\n\\makebox[12cm]{\\textbf{PennKey}:\\ \\hrulefill}\n\\medskip\n\\makebox[12cm]{\\textbf{Lab section TA}:\\ \\hrulefill}\n\\end{flushleft}\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\textbf{Score by topic area}\\\\\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\\hline\nModel Reliability   \\\\ \\hline\nNonlinear Models &  \\\\ \\hline\nClassification & \\\\ \\hline\nClassification in R & \\\\ \\hline\nTotal & \\\\ \\hline\n\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}\n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n## 1 Model reliability \n\n\n(a) True or false, as we collect more data, the confidence interval around our parameter estimates gets bigger (wider). \n\n    - [ ] True\n    - [ ] False\n\n(b) Model reliability asks how certain we can be about our parameter estimates. Why is there uncertainty around our parameter estimates? \n\n    \\answerbox\n\n(c) True or false, a model with low reliability also has low accuracy. \n\n    - [ ] True\n    - [ ] False\n\n(d) Suppose we conduct an experiment by drawing a random sample from the population. We fit a linear model to these data. Then we repeat our experiment 10 times, fitting the same model each time. Which figure could show the fitted models for the 10 experiments? Choose all that apply.\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell layout-ncol=\"3\"}\n    ::: {.cell-output-display}\n    ![](quiz-04_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n    :::\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output-display}\n    ![](quiz-04_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-2.png){width=672}\n    :::\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output-display}\n    ![](quiz-04_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-3.png){width=672}\n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n\n    - [ ] Figure A\n    - [ ] Figure B\n    - [ ] Figure C\n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n## 2.
