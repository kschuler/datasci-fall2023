## The data

Suppose we want to study the effect hours practicing an instrument has on your ultimate skill level with the instrument. We study 500 participants who are learning to play either piano or guitar. Below we explore these data in a few ways. 

```{r}
glimpse(data)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false

ggplot(data = data, aes(x = hours, y = skill)) + 
    facet_grid(.~ instrument) +
    geom_point()

```

```{r}
data %>% 
    group_by(instrument) %>%
    summarise( 
        n = n(), 
        mean_skill = mean(skill), sd_skill = sd(skill), 
        mean_hours = mean(hours), sd_hours = sd(hours))

```

## 1 Model Fitting 

Suppose we fit a model represented by the following equation, where $x_1$ is the number of hours spent practicing, $x_2$ is the instrument, and $y$ is the skill acheived: 

$y = b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2$ 

(a) Which of the following would work to estimate the free parameters of this model? Choose one.

    - [ ] only gradient descent
    - [ ] only ordinary least squares
    - [x] both gradient descent and ordinary least squares

(b) True or false, when performing gradient descent on a **nonlinear** model, we might arrive at a local minimum and miss the global one.

    - [x] True
    - [ ] False

(c) True or False, given the model above, gradient descent and ordinary least squares would both converge on approximately the same parameter estimates.

    - [x] True
    - [ ] False

(d) The following plots a linear model of the formula `y ~ 1 + x` and one data point. Which dashed line represents the model's **residual** for this point? Circle one.

## 2 Model Fitting in R 

Questions in section 2 refer to the code below.

```{r}
#| echo: false

model <- lm(skill ~ hours + instrument_recoded, data = data)

SSE <- function(data, par){
    data %>%
        mutate(pred = 
        par[1] + par[2]*hours + par[3]*instrument_recoded) %>%
        mutate(error = skill - pred) %>%
        mutate(sq_error = error ^2) %>%
        with(sum(sq_error))
}

```

```{r}

model

#fit model with optimg 
optimg(data = data, par = c(1,1,1), fn=SSE, method = "STGD")

```

(a) Which of the following could be the model specification in R? Choose all the apply.

    - [x] `skill ~ hours + instrument_recoded`
    - [ ] `skill ~ hours * instrument_recoded`
    - [x] `skill ~ 1 + hours + instrument_recoded`

(b) In the code, `SSE()` is a function we have defined to calculate the sum of squared errors. Which of the following correctly describes the steps of calculating SSE? Choose one.

    - [x] 1) calculate the residuals, 2) square each of the residuals, 3) add them up
    - [ ] 1) calculate the residuals, 2) add them up, 3) square the sum of residuals
    - [ ] 1) calculate the residuals, 2) calculate their standard deviation, 3) square it
    - [ ] 1) calculate the residuals, 2) calculate their mean, 3) square it

(c) Using the estimated parameters from `lm()`, fill in the blanks to calculate the model's predicted value of `skill` for a participant who played the **piano** for **20 hours**. You may round to the first decimal place.

\hspace*{1cm}

        skill = 58.9 + ( 0.8 * 20 ) + ( 0.7 * 1 )

\hspace*{1cm}

(d) Which of the following is the most likely value of the sum of squared errors when the parameters $b_0$, $b_1$, and $b_2$ are all set to 0? Choose one.

    - [ ] exactly 0
    - [ ] exactly 286497.6
    - [x] a value higher than 286497.6
    - [ ] a value lower than 286497.6


## 3 Model Accuracy 

Questions in section 3 refer to the following `summary()` of the same model from section 2:

(a) Which of the following is a correct interpretation of the model's $R^2$ value? Choose one.

    - [ ] The model has a 46.49% chance of explaining the true pattern in the data.
    - [x] The model explains 46.49% of the variance found in the data.
    - [ ] The sample shows 46.49% of the variance found in the population.

(b) Which of the following is true about the model's $R^2$? Choose all that apply.

    - [x] tends to overestimate $R^2$ on the population 
    - [ ] tends to underestimate $R^2$ on the population
    - [ ] tends to overestimate $R^2$ on the sample
    - [ ] tends to underestimate $R^2$ on the sample

\newpage

(c) Which one of the following is true about $R^2$? Use the below formula as a guide and choose one.

    $R^2=1-\frac{unexplained \; variance}{total \; variance}$

    - [ ] The unexplained variance refers to the fact that linear model haveh low accuracy.
    - [ ] The total variance is about the overall variability of the data in the population.
    - [x] $R^2$ of 0 means that the model predicts the mean of the data but nothing else.
    - [ ] $R^2$ of 1 means that the model will be perfect at predicting new data points.

(d) Which of the following is a correct statement about estimating $R^2$ for the _population_? Choose all that apply.

    - [ ] We can use OLS
    - [x] We can use bootstrapping
    - [x] We can use cross-validation
    - [ ] We must go out and collect more samples from the population

## 4 Model Accuracy in R 

Questions in section 4 refer to the following code:

```{r}
# we divide the data 
set.seed(2) 
splits <- vfold_cv(data, v = 20)

# model secification 
model_spec <- 
  linear_reg() %>%  
  set_engine(engine = "lm")  

# add a workflow
our_workflow <- 
  workflow() %>%
  add_model(model_spec) %>%  
  add_formula(skill ~ hours + instrument_recoded) 

# fit models 
fitted_models <- 
  fit_resamples(object = our_workflow, 
                resamples = splits) 

fitted_models %>%
  collect_metrics()
```

(a) In the output above, what is the $R^2$ estimate for the population?

    - [ ] 23.8
    - [x] 0.468
    - [ ] 0.468 + 0.0267

(b) In the code above, which method did we use to estimate $R^2$ on the population? Choose one.

    - [x] k-fold cross-valiation 
    - [ ] leave one out cross-valiation
    - [ ] boostrapping 

(c) In the code above, how many models did we fit when calling `fit_resamples()`? 

    - [ ] 10
    - [x] 20
    - [ ] 100 

(d) You are no longer doing a valid cross-validation if you change (choose all that apply):

    - [ ] How many iterations you want to do.
    - [ ] How much data you want to use for each part of training vs. testing.
    - [x] Whether models are fitted to the entire sample instead of a part of the sample
    - [x] Whether models are tested on the training data instead of the testing data
