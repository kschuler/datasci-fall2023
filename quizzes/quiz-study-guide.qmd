You will receive a single score (0-4, see [rubric](/rubric.qmd)) for each topic area representing your understanding of the course material in that area.  A great way to study for quizzes in general is to (1) study the lecture notes and (2) quiz yourself with the labs. 

## Quiz 1 

Quiz 1 will test the following learning objectives, divided into 6 topic areas. For each topic area, you should be able to do the list that follows. You can think of this as a studying checklist!

1. **R Basics: general**
    - Assign an object to a valid variable name, list all variables in the environment and remove them
    - Use packages and differentiate between installing and loading 
    - Get help with a function or package from R
    - Return information about an object, including its structure, data type, length, and attributes
    - Explain what functions and control flow are; differentiate between types of control flow
2. **R Basics: vectors, operations, and subsetting** 
    - Distinguish between an atomic vector and a list
    - Create atomic vectors and determine their data types
    - Differentiate between implicit and explicit coercion and coerce an object to another type 
    - Use arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators on vectors 
    - Explain how more complex data structures are built from atomic vectors and create them
    - Distinguish between `NA` and `NULL` 
    - Subset vectors and higher dimensional objects with the `[`, `[[` and `$` operators 
3. **Data importing**
    - Load the `tidyverse`, recognize the included packages, and critique code for redundant loading
    - Construct a tidy dataset and critique whether a given dataset is tidy
    - Use the map function from the `purr` package
    - Create a tibble and distinguish between a tibble and a data frame 
    - Use `readr` to read delimited files and determine whether `readr` can read files of a given type
    - Use `col_types` to add a column specifications and explain how readr guesses without it
    - Solve the 3 most common importing problems we discussed in class
4. **Data visualization: basics**
    - Describe how to create a plot with `ggplot2` including the 3 basic requirements 
    - Distinguish between mapping and setting aesthetics
    - Describe how `ggplot2` maps categorical variables to aesthetics and
    interpret the 3 common warnings people encounter in this process
    - Interpret `ggplot()` calls with explicit or implicit arguments for data and mapping 
    - Recognize the geoms we discussed in class and select which to use for a given situation
    - Differentiate between globally and locally defined mappings and recognize them in given plot (or code)
5. **Data visualization: layers**
    - Use the `position` argument to modify the position of the geoms in `geom_bar()` or `geom_point()`
    - Describe `stat="identity"` and describe the default transformations for `geom_bar()`, `geom_histogram()`, and `geom_smooth()`
    - Set the smoothing method for `geom_smooth()` and the bins or bindwidth for `geom_histogram()` 
    - Facet a plot with `facet_wrap()` and `facet_grid()` 
    - Modify axis, legend, and plot labels with `labs()` 
    - Apply a given theme to a plot and adjust the base font size or family.
    - Describe scales and recognize the outcome of adding a scale layer
6. **Data wrangling**
    - Describe the common structure of `dplyr` functions (aka verbs)
    - Combine `dplyr` functions with the pipe operator to solve complex problems
    - Manipulate rows with `filter()`, `arrange()`, and `distinct()` 
    - Maniuplate columns with `mutate()`, `select()`, and `rename()` 
    - Group and summarise data with `group_by()`, `summarise()`, and `ungroup()` 
    - Evaulate `dplyr` functions that include the common arguments we covered in class 

## Quiz 2

Quiz 2 will test the following learning objectives, divided into 3 topic areas. For each topic area, you should be able to do the list that follows. You can think of this as a studying checklist!


1. **Sampling distribution**
    - Explore a dataset with an appropriate figure (histogram, boxplot, scatterplot) and summary statistics appropriate for the distribution.
    - Recognize uniform and Gaussian probability distributions in a plot or equation and use R's functions `d*()`, `p*()`, and `r*()` to work with these distributions
    - Explain the difference between the parameter and the paramter estimate
    - Construct the sampling distribution of a paramater estimate with `infer` and quantify the spread of the distribution with a confidence interval.

2. **Hypothesis testing**
    - Given a set of data, implement the 3-step hypothesis testing framework **nonparametrically**: (1) Pose a null hypothesis, (2) quantify how likely a given pattern of results is under the null, and (3) determine whether to reject the null (conceptually and with the `infer` framework).
    - Given a theoretical distriubiton (e.g. t), implement the 3-step hypothesis testing framework **parametrically**.
    - Given an observed correlation, determine whether a correlation is positive, negative, or no correlation. 
    - Explain correlation as model building
3. **Model specification**
    - Classify a model as supervised or unsupervised, regression or classification, and linear or nonlinear
    - Identify the response and explanatory variables from a given research question or model 
    - Recognize the 4 ways of writing the linear model equation 
    - Select the equation (e.g $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2$) or R expression (e.g. `y ~ year + gender`) for a plotted model


<!-- 4. **Model fitting**
    - Estimate the free parameters of a linear model with the gradient descent approach
    - Estimate the free parameters of a linear model with the OLS approach -->
